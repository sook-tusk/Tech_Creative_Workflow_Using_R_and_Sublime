# Creative Workflow using R and Sublime Text

## Efficient workflow: Jumping between projects and files like a ninja

**Nov 2023, Sook Kim - University of Manchester**

Welcome to the workshop! We will discuss challenges in project management and creative ways to manage the ongoing project better using one of the most versatile and powerful tools, **Sublime Text 4**. I will walk you through all the steps necessary to integrate R and Sublime in [Part 3](#part3). This training aims to *revolutionise* your workflow. Please note that you will experience a *qualitative* difference in writing, and project/resources management. You may not save much time at first (as this involves some learning curve), but it is the qualitative aspect that you will appreciate over time! 

*Target audience*: Anyone who is engaged in coding and/or data management, and keen to explore software or tools available to improve their workflow. At a practical level, students or researchers who need to manage multiple projects and need a system that allows ongoing coding training at your own pace will benefit from this training. The other important purpose is to help facilitate your creative workflow! Soon, you'll see what I mean!

*Update: The R-Visual Studo Code integration is available*. See [Part 4](#part4)

# Preliminary Steps

Install R (<https://www.r-project.org/>) and Sublime Text 4 (<https://www.sublimetext.com/download>). In Sublime Text (ST) menu,

-   In ST, Go to `Tools > Install Package Control...` and allow a few seconds to run.

-   In ST, open a folder by accessing File menu. Then, press `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+B (Replace Ctrl with Cmd in Mac)`. Repeat to see what happens.

The user-contributed packages in ST are managed by Package Control. We need to install Package Control first, to be able to install packages that permit rich features of ST! The shortcut, `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+B`, enables us to access the entire folder tree (called sidebar) in ST. If a folder is open, ST reveals the entire hierarchy.

Before we proceed, let's install *languageserver* to help ST communicate with R. This can be done later in ST, but let's keep it simple for now by running the code in RStudio. Windows PC users also need to install *Rtools* compatible with your R version (<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>) , prior to languageserver installation, to pre-empt any errors.

-   In RStudio, run, `install.packages("languageserver")`

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This step is crucial. Please ensure languageserver installation was successfully done, and no errors has occurred (See below [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) to resolve any errors). Now, we are ready for next steps! (*Unlike RStudio, ST needs manual setup. It involves installing (user-contributed) packages and configuring them to let ST recognise R language and prints output*).

# Part 1: Managing projects

Have you been given training on project management? Why or why not? Often times, we embark on an amazing project but we may have to revisit in six months' time or collaborate with others. Let's contemplate on a few things.

-   How often do you struggle locating folders and files?
-   Do you memorise code or do you google whenever needed?
-   Do you feel there is a need to better organise tutorial materials?
-   Do you like repeating tasks?
-   How comfortable are you with sharing your code?

It'd be nice to have a project template with relevant folders ready and organising is nicely done already.

## Project folder management :

-   **Folders**: R script that creates folders/sub-folders (In the repository, see [example folder-creating R script](Project_management/03_Create_Folders.R) located under *Project_management* folder.

-   **Folder/file naming conventions**: consider giving sequence to sort in numbers

-   **Sub-folders**: If the file is buried under somewhere, it's time to consider sub-folders.

-   **Section dividers**: Sometimes, we just need many folders and hiding them in a sub-folder may not be optimal. In such instance, you can be creative to stand out particular folders among others.

## An important consideration for Code sub-folders

In structuring "code sub-folders": An important consideration can be given to...?

How about accessing this folder hierarchy while working on a particular project? It'd be nice to know the current file's location as you write code, which will enable ongoing organising! Is there any available tool I can utilise?

## Training and development:

The coding journey is an ongoing process and you may benefit from your own code bank. Create a master tutorial folder that allows you to access any code example that you have been exposed to. Discovering a good solution in `stackoverflow` is only one step. Before it evaporates, we need a good "home" to house this *precious*(!) code for future access.

Now, how do we access the most relevant file immediately? Manually navigating folders in File Explorer will be very slow. More importantly, how do we minimise disruption in your current workflow and shift your focus from training to the current project?

# Part 2: Introducing Modern External Text Editors

### and their caveats

This is where Modern External Text Editors come in. Modern Text Editors are like `RStudio`. As the name suggests they are used to write code. The main strength of these is that they often offer many useful features, which are not available in RStudio. They are usually light-weight, fast, and aesthetically-pleasing. RStudio is a great platform for your projects. Once you are proficient with RStudio, you may consider other options. It'll be efficient if you can allocate other editors to conducting tasks such as housing tutorial materials or testing code. This will help with your workflow; By separating tasks, you can minimise disruption.

You'll learn a new function, test it in your tutorial environment before seamlessly returning to your project at hand. Also, it is a bonus that there is no need to tidy up code afterwards (well, not so thoroughly!). Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code are two popular External Text Editors among many. The reason behind choosing these is that the customisation possibility is almost endless! From aesthetics and shortcuts, you can adjust almost anything to meet your needs.

However, I must highlight that given the moderate-to-steep learning curve, the potential time and efforts required to use editors confidently should not be ignored. You may need to tackle various aspects of technical issues! Please weight up pros and cons as you play with them. Remember to learn at your own pace! If you think the benefits do not outweigh, it's best to leave this for now, or reconsider your learning pace, and revisit when you are more equipped. Personally, it is too great to dismiss it, though!

## Opening the R_Tutorial folder in Sublime Text (ST)

While many programming languages can be run from within Sublime Text, our main purpose is to set it as a platform to learn and test our R code.

-   First, we will create our own R-tutorial folder in File Explorer. We'll open it in ST.

-   Launch ST and see the entire folder tree (called sidebar) (Recall Ctrl+K, Ctrl+B).

-   Go to File \> Open Folder... and choose the R_Tutorial folder. You'll see the entire folder hierarchy at a glance.

-   Right-click R-Tutorial folder, then explore options.

-   Open the provided files there. An *.md* file is essentially a *.txt* file but it comes with many frills. Try with \# and \## to make a to-do list (Converting is not necessary as our goal is making notes!).

## Demonstration of key features in ST

-   Jumping between projects (using **Project Manager** package, Ctrl+Alt+P)
-   File management (using **A file Icon** package)
-   File management (using **SideBarEnhancements** package)
    -   move files between panels
    -   find location of the current file in the folder tree
    -   launch a particular tutorial file for a quick reference (Ctrl+P)
    -   New View into file - no more back and forth scrolling!
-   Jumping between headings/sections (using **Table of comments** package)
    -   Simply add > in front of a heading
    -   Press F1 to trigger the list of headings/sections and jump straight to a chosen heading
    -   Type _/* TOC */_ then press F1 to automatically print/update TOC (in Rscripts, add # in front of /* TOC */)
-   Running R code interactively

# Part 3: Integrating R and Sublime Text <a href="#part3" id="part3"/>

## Step 1: Install packages in Sublime Text (ST)

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`. This triggers an *empty* drop-down window. This window is called Command Palette. The cursor is waiting for a command in the Command Palette. Start typing "Install Package" then press Enter. In a few seconds, when the Command Palette window appears again, type "r-ide", and press Enter. Notice the updating message at the bottom left of the ST window, to see the confirmation of the installation status (such as "*R-IDE package was installed successfully*"). Repeat this process to install other packages.The packages we need are :

-   R-IDE (to get syntax highlights),

-   LSP (Language Server support in Sublime to use R)

-   SendCode (to help communicate ST and Terminal), and

-   Terminus (to use as console showing output).

![](image/Installpackages.png)

## Step 2: Configure ST
Once relevant packages are installed, we need to change settings for *each* package to communicate with R, to be able to send R code from within Sublime. We'll use Sublime menu to access settings. In Sublime Text menu (Windows PC), go to `Preferences > Package Settings > `. Mac users can access the package settings by clicking `Sublime Text > Settings > Package Settings` on the top left corner of your screen. 

You'll see the full list of packages you have installed. Select the package you'd like to configure. The panel on the left is default. The right panel concerns the user customisation file. Copy below or edit as necessary. 

### R-IDE

We ensure Sublime Text recognises your R version and path. In the list of packages, select `Package Settings > R-IDE > Settings`. In the user customisation file, copy below or edit as necessary. Comments are indicated by `//`.

In Windows:
```py
{
    "r_binary": "C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.3.1\\bin\\x64\\R.exe",
}
```

In Mac:
```py
{
// Mac, Linux
    "r_binary": "/usr/local/bin/R",	
}
```

### LSP

No need to customise.

### SendCode

In the blank user customisation area, paste the following.

```py
{
// Mac, Linux and Windows
    "r":
    {
        "prog": "terminus",
        "bracketed_paste_mode": false,
    },
}
```


### Terminus

Customise as necessary. *Terminus is a variant name referring to Terminal such as Command Prompt, PowerShell, and Bash*.

In Windows:
```py
{
// Windows
      "default_config": {
         "windows": "Rterm",
  // If Radian won't work, use Command Prompt, then type R from an R script
  // to manually activate Rterm. Specifying the full radian path can also help.
        // "windows": "Command Prompt",
    },
    // a list of available shells to execute
    "shell_configs": [
        {
            "name": "Rterm",
            "cmd": ["radian.exe"],
            "env": {},
            "enable": true,
            "platforms": ["windows"]
        },
  ],
} 
```
In Mac: please replace `yourname` as appropriate.
```py
{
    "default_config": {
        "osx": "Rterm",      // login shell
    },
    // a list of available shells to execute
    "shell_configs": [
        {
            "name": "Rterm",
            "cmd": "/Users/yourname/anaconda3/bin/radian",
            "env": {},
            "enable": true,
            "platforms": ["osx"]
        },
  ],
} 
```
If unsure about the radian path, type "whereis radian" in Terminal. In Linux, the path can be "/home/yourname/anaconda3/bin/radian".

## Step 3: Install Radian

This setup allows you to run R code in ST, but the console will print all in one colour. We need yet another python-powered programme called *radian* to get console output's highlights. *Radian* will automatically open `Rterm` (meaning R terminal). *Radian* is not available in ST, and you need to install manually outside of ST, via **anaconda**, the central python ecosystem manager.

### 3.1 Download and install anaconda.

Download here (<https://www.anaconda.com/download/>) and install it. 

### 3.2 Install radian

In your PC, launch anaconda navigator. Then, go to:

`Environments > base(root) > greentriangle > Open Terminal`

![](image/anaconda.png)

and execute the following command: (it should be pip3, not pip)

> pip3 install -U radian

![](image/radian2.png)

## Step 4: Complete the settings by defining Custom Shortcuts (key bidnings)
In Mac: 
Access key bindings file by pressing **Command+Shit+P > type Preferences: Key Bindings > Enter**.
Copy the entire code below to your custom (user) key bidnings file.
Ensure to replace `yourname` as appropriate. 

You can also refer to the example keymap file in Windows/Mac in the repository (In the repository, see [Example-Sublime-Keymap](Sublime_Tutorial/Example-Mac.Sublime-Keymap) located under *Sublime_Tutorial* folder.
 
```py
[
// To open radian (radian opens Rterminal automatically to run R codes)
// To make two columns, go to View > Layout > Columns:2. 
// Put the cursor in Column2.
// In Mac, "command+alt+r" also works.
    { "keys": ["command+option+r"],
        "command": "terminus_open",
        "args": {
            "post_window_hooks": [
                ["carry_file_to_pane", {"direction": "right"}]
            ],
            "cmd" : "/Users/yourname/anaconda3/bin/radian"
        }
    },

// Assignment operator, <- with "alt(option)+ -" works both in .R and .Rmd
    {
        "keys":["alt+-"],
        "command": "insert_snippet",
        "args": {"contents": "<- $0"},
        "context": [
           { "key": "selector", "operator": "equal",
             "operand": "source.r"}
        ],

    },
// Pipe operator, %>% with command+shift+m (Mac), ctrl+shift+m (Windows)
    { 
        "keys": ["command+shift+m"], 
        "command": "insert_snippet",
        "args": { "contents": "%>% $0"},
        "context": [
          { "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", 
            "operand": "source.r" },
      ],
    },
]

```

## Step 5: Add paths as appropriate (Windows only)
This step is not necessary for Mac users. Windows PC need an extra step. Paths is one of the Windows PC system properties. Windows PCs look for an .exe in the paths set in the environment variable window. To bring up the environment variable window, type `env` at the search bar placed at the bottom left of the task bar.

![](image/env.png)

Add R, Sublime Text, anaconda3, and radian folders. The paths for anacoda3 are not strictly required. If you are planning on running Python code in editors, consider adding them as well, though. 
Please note that .exe is not added at the end of the path. For R, it will be:

`C:\Program Files\R\R-4.3.1\bin\x64`

Restart PC after environment setting has changed.For the detailed instructions, see here [add-Windows-paths]
(https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/). For Mac PCs, follow similar procedures as necessary.

## Step 6: All done. Test running R code in ST

In Sublime, we create a side by side view by going to the menu, *View > Layout > Columns: 2* and display R code on the left and Terminal panel on the right. Leave the cursor on the right panel where Terminal will launch.
There are two ways to open a Terminal to send the R code to. 

- Using shortcuts: Press `command+option+r` in Mac (ctrl+alt+r in Windows) to open an Rterm (R terminal).
  Then, go to your R Script file and press `Ctrl+Enter` to run a line of code or blocks. The output will be printed in Rterm.
  
- Using Sublime menu: (watch the video for this procedure)
Press `Ctrl+Shit+P`, type **SendCode: Choose Program**, then choose **Terminus**. This needs to be done only once.

Now, we are set to instruct Sublime to launch *Rterm*. Press Ctrl+Shit+P and type :

> Terminus: Open Default Shell in Tab (View).

When *Rterm* opens, run R code by pressing `Ctrl+Enter` in any R script file. *Voila*!

Close Sublime Text and test if Rterm is activated. Allow a minute for Rterm (from previous session) to relaunch itself (or click anywhere in Rterm for activation). Open another Rterm to ensure the current setup is working as intended. From now on, you can simply open Rterm to run R code. Well-done! :+1:

## Troubleshooting <a href="#Troubleshooting" id="Troubleshooting"/>


### Languageserver not connecting

.Rprofile needs updating. To do so, we need to locate, then open the file. Run the code below to find the path of .Rprofile.

```R
file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), ".Rprofile")                            
```
The output, `[1] "C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents/.Rprofile"` indicates the location. Launch File Explorer and open the file. It is a plain text file. Add the location detail in the .Rprofile.

``` py
options(langserver_library = 'C:/Users/yourname/Documents/R/win-library/4.3/languageserver')
    
    .First <- function () {
        path_to_libraries <- "C:/Users/yourname/Documents/R/win-library/4.3"
        .libPaths(c(path_to_libraries, .libPaths() ) )
    }
```
If this doesn't work, you may reset the langserver_library as `C:/Users/yourname/AppData/Local/R/win-library/`. I recommend examining the location to verify the path and update the .Rprofile as appropriate. 

### Languageserver installation error

You may encounter this permission denied error (your error message may differ).

``` py
mv: cannot move '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/rlang' to '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/00LOCK-rlang/rlang': Permission denied
```

This is due to conflicts caused by existing library files by earlier R version. All R packages you will install will be stored under library folder. If you have multiple R versions, the library settings need updating. For instance, you installed R 3.6 earlier and attempt to install a newer version, R 4.3, while keeping the older version. In such case, ensure to create a new folder indicating the newer version before proceeding with languageserver installation. The possible paths may be either `C:/Users/yourname/Documents/R/win-library` or `C:/Users/yourname/AppData/Local/R/win-library/`. In the correct path, check your R version folder (e.g. 4.3) exists. If not, create one, then install languageserver. Ensure that installation is successful.

### Rterm would not launch
Ensure that you have correctly specified paths in Terminus for Radian. Also, check the settings for other packages.

**A quick fix** would be to launch Terminus using an alternative Terminal such as Command Prompt (`In Command Palette, choose Terminus: List Shells > Command Prompt > Open in Tab`) Then, go to an R script and type R. By pressing `Ctrl+Enter`, you can launch Rterm yourself to run R code. The syntax in Rterm is not highlighted, though.

**A more sustainable approach** would be to remove R-IDE and LSP packages in `Command Palette` before reinstalling these packages. Sublime will remember your earlier custom settings and take care of the rest. Restart PC and try again. If this doesn't help, consider removing/reinstalling anaconda and radian, or even R. As your PC updates with newer technology (*watch out your PC updates!*), it's a good idea to maintain the optimal (almost) up-to-date computing environment.

# Part 4: Integrating R and Visual Studio Code <a href="#part4" id="part4"/>
If you have already installed Radian, the remaining steps are rather simple. Packages in Sublime is called Extensions in VS Code. To trigger command palette, press F1 or Command+Shift+P. Type any command you'd like and test. The principle is similar to the one in Sublime.

## In Windows: 
In the repository, see [VSCode_R_Windows_integration](VScode_R_Windows_integrate.md). 

## In Mac:
In the repository, see [VSCode_R_mac_integration](VSCode_R_mac_integrate.md).


# R tips
## TIP 1: Paste/export R code with syntax highlighting

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and Notepad++ offers extremely handy shortcuts for this task. Open an R script file in VSCode and copy and paste onto an email or in Word. It's very handy when you seek help with fixing errors. VS Code is free to download here (<https://code.visualstudio.com/>). In Notepad++ (Windows PC), highlight the portion of code then go to menu, *Plugins \> NppExport \> Copy HTML to clipboard* (I use `Ctrl+Shift+H` as a shortcut). Then, paste onto an email or in Word. The code highlights are nicely retained!
- Sublime Text 4 also supports this functionality. Access `Copy as HTML` command under Edit menu. You can also set a shortcut. I usually set a consistent key across editors. 
  ```json
  //> ============ Windows, Code copying ===============
  { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+h"], "command": "copy_as_html",
    "args": { "enclosing_tags": true } },

    //> ============ Mac, Code copying ===============
  { "keys": ["command+shift+h"], "command": "copy_as_html",
    "args": { "enclosing_tags": true } },
  ```

## TIP 2: Consider Sublime_Tutorial folder
If there are many new concepts to grasp, you may consider keeping the information in a dedicated tutorial folder. It'll be handy when you upgrade your computing system or migrate to a newer PC. If you are fixing any errors, I recommend logging the details; you will need to remember what worked, and not worked, and why! 

## TIP 3: Decide location and filename first

### before creating the contents

Separate creating contents and saving tasks. This way, you are less likely to experience data loss!

> [!TIP]
> To prevent any data loss, I strongly recommend that you perform **regular backups** before any significant changes. Create a backup folder with a date and copy all contents from here:

> C:\\Users\\yourname\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sublime Text

# Conclusion

In this workshop, we discussed how to use Sublime Text for efficient project and resources management. The side-by-side display of folder tree and contents files allows us to facilitate ongoing project management with minimum disruption. Accessing a particular file and maintaining tutorial/training materials can also be carried out with ease in Sublime Text.

Please consult other excellent resources on Sublime Text for further information. Discovering other useful packages (<https://packagecontrol.io/>) and customising shortcuts will greatly improve your workflow. You may set *Ctrl+Alt+R* to open Rterm. Please see the [example keymap](Sublime_Tutorial/Example.sublime-keymap) setup file under Sublime_Tutorial folder in this repository. Using Sublime or VSCode for writing/memos is another possibility. 

Please note that the **Terminus** package in Sublime should not be confused with **Terminal** package. An implementation of Rmarkdown in Sublime can also be considered. You may also consider the integration of Visual Studio Code and R, as the similar integration principle will apply. This is beyond of the scope of the current workshop. Are you a Stata user? You may also benefit from here (<https://github.com/sook-tusk/Tech_Integrate_Stata_R_with_Editors>). 

I hope Sublime Text helps manage your project, and improve your workflow for years to come. While being mindful of caveats, I really hope you utilise this amazing tool, Sublime, wisely. Thank you, and please get in touch with your success stories!
